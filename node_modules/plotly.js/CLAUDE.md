# Claude Code Assistant Notes

## Python Environment Management

- When working in a `uv` virtual environment, always use `uv pip install packagename` instead of `pip install packagename` to install Python packages
- The virtual environment is located at `venv/plotly.js/bin/activate`
- Activate the environment with: `source venv/plotly.js/bin/activate`
